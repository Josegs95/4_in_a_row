<h1>Still working on it (3-1-25)</h1>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>This is my first application to add to my portfolio. In this project I wanted to practice the MVC file structure too.</p>
<p>The application consists in the classic Tic Tac Top but in its version of four (4 in-a-row). The game starts with the red pieces always and it is designed to
be played againsts another player (PvP). Each time a player wins, the score of that player is updated.</p>
<p><em>When I finish the project, I will upload some images of the app</em></p>

<h3>Added features:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Added a starting page where welcome the user and explain a bit the game</li>
  <li>Added a option to play vs the computer!. The option is on the top menu</li>
  <li>Added Javadoc comments to the code</li>
</ul>
<h2>Libreries</h2>
<p>MigLayout: https://github.com/mikaelgrev/miglayout</p>

<h2>TO-DO list:</h2>
<small><em>Optional</em></small>
<ul>
  <li>Add some images to this file</li>
</ul>

<h2>Known issues</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The middle message in the BoardPanelView (with the text of "Informaci√≥n") moves each time the turn changes, because some label on the left set its style to bold. I have tried to fix this but I couldn't do it. If you know how to fix it (I don't want to put absolute size to the components), feel free to do a pull request!.</li>
</ul>
