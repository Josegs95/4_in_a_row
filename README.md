<h1>Still working on it (3-1-25)</h1>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>This is my first application to add to my portfolio. In this project I wanted to practice the MVC file structure too.</p>
<p>The application consists in the classic Tic Tac Top but in its version of four (4 in-a-row). The game starts with the red pieces always and it is designed to
be played againsts another player (PvP). Each time a player wins, the score of that player is updated.</p>
<p><em>When I finish the project, I will upload some images of the app</em></p>
<h2>Libreries</h2>

<h2>TO-DO list:</h2>

  <li>Play alone, vs randomess (almost fully implemented)</li>
  <li>Can save state of a session into a file, and load it</li>
</ul>
